# SkyStrip

This usermod displays the weather forecast on several parallel LED strips.
It currently includes Temperature, Wind, Delta, and Cloud views. Cloud view shades
day/night colors by cloud cover and blends in precipitation colors scaled by
probability of precipitation. Delta view visualizes temperature changes over the
previous 24â€¯hours with brightness scaling from dark when neither temperature nor
humidity changes to full intensity for large shifts. Color saturation still
indicates drying or moistening air.

## Installation

Add the following to your active environment in `platformio_override.ini`:
```
