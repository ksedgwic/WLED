### What am I looking at?
Each LED represents a scheduled arrival. Colors map to the legend. Dots move right as arrival time approaches.

### How recent is the data?
Continuously updated from official GTFS-Realtime/agency sources. If a feed drops, we fall back to last known schedule.

### What do blinking or dim lights mean?
Blinking = status change (delay/new estimate). Dimmer = farther out in time; brighter = imminent.

### Can I change which lines are shown?
Yesâ€”use the config file or app to enable/disable routes and tweak colors.
