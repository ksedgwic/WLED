### What am I looking at?
Each lit LED represents a scheduled departure. The top of strip shows
transit arriving from the north and heading south.  The bottom of the
strip shows transit arriving from the south and heading north.  The
tape in the middle represents the point of departure.  The marks above
and below the center mark show good times to leave to catch the
departing transit.

The DepartStrip connects to the official transit feeds and updates the
estimates every minute.

When multiple transit departures are close enough in time the lights will
alternate between each of their colors.

### How do I connect it to my WiFi the first time (or move it to a new WiFi)?
1. Plug the light controller into the wall power (it's not important if the lights are attached).
2. Temporarily switch your phone's WiFi to the "WLED-AP" created by the controller.
3. A form appears, enter your network name and password in the top fields and click "Save & Connect"
4. Connect your phone back to your WiFi network (if it hasn't by itself already)

The controller should automatically reconnect when powered on from now on.

### How can I see and change the configuration?
1. Install the "WLED Native" app on your phone.
2. Open "WLED Native", choose your light strip from the menu
3. Choose "Config" -> "Usermods", scroll down to "DepartStrip" ...
