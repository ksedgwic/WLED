### What am I looking at?
Each lit LED corresponds to an upcoming departure. Colors identify the
line. The top strip moves north→south departures left to right; the
bottom strip moves south→north departures. The hash marks around the
center LED mark good moments to leave for the platform or stop. The
board refreshes every minute with the latest estimates from the
agencies.
