### What am I looking at?
Each lit LED represents a scheduled departure. The color identifies the bus/train.

The top half of the display shows transit arriving from the north and heading south.  The bottom half of the display  shows transit arriving from the south and heading north.  The tape in the middle represents the point of departure.

As buses/trains get closer to departure they move towards the center of the display.

The tape marks above and below the center tape mark show a good time to leave to catch a particular bus/train.

Each minute the DepartStrip connects to the official transit feeds and updates the estimates.

When multiple transit departure estimates converge the lights will alternate between each of their colors.
